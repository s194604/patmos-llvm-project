// SPScope contains all information on the single-path scopes in a function.
// It models the scopes as a tree, where the root is the scope of the function,
// called the top-level scope, and each child is a loop inside that function,
// called subscopes. Subscopes of subscopes are nested loops.
//
// The static function SPScope::createSPScopeTree can be used to construct
// the scope tree from a MachineFunction.
//
// Also contains SPScopeWalker, which can be extended to walk the tree
// of scopes.
